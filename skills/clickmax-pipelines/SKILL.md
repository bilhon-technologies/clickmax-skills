## When this applies

Use this skill for pipeline/stage/card operations: create or change pipelines and stages, move cards, assign attendants, inspect history/risk, import leads into pipelines, or read pipeline analytics/settings.

Not this skill:

- lead search and identity -> `clickmax-leads`
- manual tagging or segment/list membership -> `clickmax-tags` / `clickmax-list-segments`
- building or reading a saved Insights dashboard of opportunities BI -> `clickmax-insights-dashboards`

## Key assumptions

- stage/pipeline ids must be resolved before mutation
- moving cards can change card status from the destination stage semantics
- `won` and `lost` are terminal stage meanings; only put them on stages meant to close opportunities
- auto-assignment strategy changes who owns new/changed cards and should be treated as operational policy, not cosmetic text
- settings can include idle SLA threshold, lost reasons, default priority, temperature, currency, and card display fields
- some move paths may be blocked by stage passage rules
- delete semantics are soft-hide/remove-from-board at the backend level, but still user-visible destructive actions
- attendant assignment/settings writes replace current structures, not patch arbitrary fragments
- Every money amount here is an INTEGER IN CENTS — `cards_create`/`cards_update`'s `value`, `opportunities_bulk_set_value`'s `value`, `cards_list`/`opportunities_query`'s `valueMin`/`valueMax`, and `commissionFixedCents`. `19990` = R$ 199,90. Neither side divides or multiplies: a decimal like `199.90` is not "reais", it is a fifth of a cent. Commission PERCENTAGES are basis points instead (`525` = 5,25%).
- `cards_*` and `opportunities_bulk_*` act on the SAME thing — an opportunity card. The bulk family is not "the lead version" of the single-card tools; `opportunities_bulk_apply_tags` writes the exact same card↔tag link as `cards_apply_tags`, just over a whole selection. Tagging the CONTACT is a different domain entirely (`crm_tags_apply_to_leads`, see `clickmax-tags`).
- Bulk targeting is `cardIds` (an explicit non-empty list of CARD ids) OR `allMatching: true` with a `scope` `{ pipelineId, stageId?, filters? }` — mutually exclusive, one required, and never `opportunityIds`/`leadIds`. Sending both or neither is a 400.

- `id` means a DIFFERENT thing depending on the tool — same param name, no `pipelineId`/`stageId` alias to disambiguate. On `stages_list`, `stages_create`, and `stages_reorder`, `id` is the PIPELINE id (the stage itself is created/reordered by name/list, not addressed). On `stages_update` and `stages_delete`, `id` is the STAGE id. Do not assume it means the same thing across sibling tools — check which one before calling.

## Thought process

1. Resolve the exact pipeline/stage/card first.
2. Distinguish card mutation from pipeline metadata/settings mutation.
3. When moving or reordering, preserve board semantics and current anchors.
4. Confirm destructive changes when intent is not already explicit.

## Execute guide

- Resolve the board before writes: use `mcp__plugin_clickmax_clickmax__pipelines_list` to find the pipeline, `mcp__plugin_clickmax_clickmax__stages_list` with `id` (the pipeline id, not `pipelineId`) to map stage ids, and `mcp__plugin_clickmax_clickmax__cards_list` with `pipelineId`, `stageId`, pagination, and optional filters such as `search` or `tagIds` when the target card still needs disambiguation.

- Creating a NEW pipeline with its stages already defined (the common "create a pipeline with stages X, Y, Z" ask): pass the stages inline in `mcp__plugin_clickmax_clickmax__pipelines_create`'s optional `stages` array (`{name, color?, type?, metaPixelEvent?}` per stage, `type` defaults to `in_progress` — use `won`/`lost` on the terminal stages) instead of one pipeline call plus N separate `stages_create` calls. One call creates the whole board.

- Create cards with `mcp__plugin_clickmax_clickmax__cards_create`, passing the target `leadIds`, `pipelineId`, and `stageId`; include `value` and `attendantIds` only when the user wants those set at creation time. Do not guess a card-creation tool name outside pipelines — `cards_create` is the only one; there is no `pipelines_create_card`.
  - Brand-new/fictional contacts: create each one first via `clickmax-leads`'s `leads_create` (one call per contact, returns the new lead id), THEN batch them into `cards_create` calls using that pipeline's `pipelineId`/`stageId` and `leadIds: [<the returned id>]`.
  - EXISTING contacts (e.g. "pegue os últimos N leads e adicione na pipeline X"): this is a TWO-DOMAIN task — resolve the leads first via `clickmax-leads`'s `leads_search` (no special sort needed for "last N", see that skill), resolve the pipeline/stage via `pipelines_list`/`stages_list` here, THEN call `cards_create` once per resolved lead id with that `pipelineId`/`stageId`. Load both skills' guidance for this request — do not treat it as pipelines-only just because a pipeline is named.

- Change many cards at once with the `mcp__plugin_clickmax_clickmax__opportunities_bulk_*` family instead of looping the single-card tools: `opportunities_bulk_move`, `_apply_tags`, `_assign_attendants`, `_set_value`, `_set_priority`, `_set_temperature`, `_set_closing_date`, `_set_custom_field`, `_create_next_action`, `_delete`. Resolve the selection first (`mcp__plugin_clickmax_clickmax__cards_list` or `mcp__plugin_clickmax_clickmax__opportunities_query`), then send it as `cardIds`, or describe it once as `allMatching: true` + `scope`. Each call answers `{ mode: "sync", affected }` up to 200 cards, or `{ mode: "async", jobId }` above that — an async answer means NOTHING has happened yet; poll `mcp__plugin_clickmax_clickmax__opportunities_bulk_job_status` with that `jobId` before reporting the change as done.

- Write an opportunity custom field with `mcp__plugin_clickmax_clickmax__opportunities_bulk_set_custom_field` — `customFieldId` from `mcp__plugin_clickmax_clickmax__custom_fields_list` with `entityType: "opportunities"`, and `value` raw for the field type (string for text/select, number for number, ISO string for date, boolean for boolean, string array for multi_select; `null` clears it). Only `text`, `number`, `date`, `boolean`, `select` and `multi_select` can be written in bulk — every other type (`currency`, `textarea`, `link`, `percentage`, `radio`, `rating`, `file`, `formula`, `json`) is refused with a 400 `Custom field type "<x>" is not supported in bulk update`. For those, write per card via `mcp__plugin_clickmax_clickmax__cards_update`'s `customFieldValues`, or pick a supported type when creating the field.

- Move cards with `mcp__plugin_clickmax_clickmax__cards_move`, passing the card `id`, the destination `stageId`, and the current relative anchor (`beforeCardId` or `afterCardId`) so the board order stays intentional; include `lossReason` only when the move path requires or justifies it.

- Assign attendants in 2 steps: first read `mcp__plugin_clickmax_clickmax__pipelines_attendant_types_get` for the pipeline's valid attendant type ids, then write `mcp__plugin_clickmax_clickmax__cards_assign_attendants` with explicit `assignments` entries containing `attendantId`, `attendantTypeId`, and `isPrimary`.

- Import leads into a pipeline with `mcp__plugin_clickmax_clickmax__cards_import_from_lists` only when the user wants board population from list/segment cohorts rather than one-off card creation.

- Inspect card behavior with `mcp__plugin_clickmax_clickmax__cards_get` for one card, `mcp__plugin_clickmax_clickmax__cards_list_by_lead` for a lead's pipeline presence, `mcp__plugin_clickmax_clickmax__cards_history` for move/change history, and `mcp__plugin_clickmax_clickmax__cards_at_risk` for cards currently flagged as operational risk.

- Update structure only after resolving the exact target object: to add a stage to an EXISTING pipeline, use `mcp__plugin_clickmax_clickmax__stages_create` with `id` = that pipeline's id (not a `pipelineId` field, and not the new stage's id — the stage has no id yet); `mcp__plugin_clickmax_clickmax__stages_update`/`mcp__plugin_clickmax_clickmax__stages_delete` instead take `id` = the STAGE's own id, since those two target one stage directly. Use `mcp__plugin_clickmax_clickmax__stages_reorder` (`id` = pipeline id) to resequence. Use `mcp__plugin_clickmax_clickmax__pipelines_create`, `mcp__plugin_clickmax_clickmax__pipelines_update`, or `mcp__plugin_clickmax_clickmax__pipelines_delete` for pipeline changes.

- Treat settings and analytics as separate from board CRUD: read current configuration with `mcp__plugin_clickmax_clickmax__pipelines_settings_get` before `mcp__plugin_clickmax_clickmax__pipelines_settings_update`, use `mcp__plugin_clickmax_clickmax__pipelines_attendant_types_set` only when changing the pipeline's attendant-role structure itself, and use `mcp__plugin_clickmax_clickmax__pipelines_analytics` for performance/throughput answers rather than card-by-card inspection.

## Report

- For structural changes: report what changed, where, and the resulting status.
- When summarizing one specific created/read pipeline in a visual card, use the pipeline name as the large headline/value. Put stage count, opportunity count, active status, and similar board metrics in pills/secondary metrics instead of replacing the headline with counts.
- For card moves: report origin -> destination and any relevant status/owner effect.
- For analytics/risk: summarize the operational takeaway, not raw board payloads.

## Warnings

- Do not guess stage ids from names when several stages are similar.
- A bulk write that comes back `mode: "async"` has NOT been applied yet. Reporting "done" off that response is how a mass update gets silently lost — poll `opportunities_bulk_job_status`, and use `opportunities_bulk_job_history` to audit or recover a `jobId` that was not kept.
- Treat a tool result flagged as an error as a FAILURE even though the transport answered 200. MCP reports a failed tool call in the result envelope (`isError: true`, the message as text), not as a JSON-RPC `error` — a caller that only inspects `error` reads "Provide non-empty cardIds OR allMatching=true with scope" as if it were a successful write. Never count rows as written on a result you did not actually read.
- `cards_create` creates ONE card per call, even when `leadIds` carries several contacts — that is the multi-contact card, not a shortcut for N cards. For one card per contact, call it once per lead id.
- Card order uses relative positioning semantics; stale anchors can misplace cards.
- Importing from lists/segments skips leads already present in the pipeline.
- If `leads_create` (or any write here) returns an empty/unexpected result for a contact you need the id of, do not silently skip it or fabricate an id — call `leads_exists_by_email`/`leads_search` (see `clickmax-leads`) to recover the real id before using it in `cards_create`, or surface the failure instead of creating a card with no lead.

## Anti-patterns

- Treating pipeline settings as harmless cosmetic edits.
- Moving cards without checking destination stage semantics.
- Using card deletion when the user only wants to hide/archive operationally.
