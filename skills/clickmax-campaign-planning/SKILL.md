name: clickmax-campaign-planning
description: Use when the user asks for a multi-week or multi-month marketing plan, campaign sequence, launch calendar or nurture strategy that should be built on the account's own history (open rates, base growth, tags, channels, brand voice) and later executed in Clickmax.
---

## When this applies

The user wants a plan that spans weeks or months (themes, channels, audience per phase, cadence, targets), and expects it to reflect THEIR account — not a generic marketing template.

Not this skill:

- one email or one automation right now -> `clickmax-flows`
- "how did my campaigns do" with no plan -> `clickmax-analytics`
- what is selling / sales trend only -> `clickmax-sales-insights`
- building the segment itself -> `clickmax-list-segments`

## Key assumptions

- A plan without the account's numbers is a failure of this skill. Every target must cite its baseline; every audience must name a real tag, list or filter and its measured size.
- Rates come as fractions (`0.295` = 29,5%); `null` = nothing sent, not zero.
- Campaign open/click rates are over sent recipients and count first opens only. Channel-wide `mcp__plugin_clickmax_clickmax__messages_metrics` rates are over reached recipients, include automations, and have no clicks — never mix the two in one comparison. WhatsApp shows up there as platform `gupshup`.
- Segments can filter by tag, list, purchase/transaction, product/offer, subscription, temperature status, score, UTM/origin, page or funnel visited, form/quiz answers, webinar attendance, lead creation date and lead fields. They CANNOT filter by "opened the last N emails", "clicked an email" or "inactive for N days". When the plan needs email-engagement behavior, use temperature status or score as the proxy and say it is a proxy.
- WhatsApp free-form text only reaches contacts inside the 24h customer-care window; everything else needs an approved template. A WhatsApp step is only real if the account has a connected number and approved templates (or the plan includes creating them as a step — see `clickmax-flows`).
- There is no waitlist entity: a "waitlist" is a tag plus an automation.

## Thought process

1. Collect before planning — always, even when the user seems to want text only. Ambiguous goal → still read the snapshot first, then ask ONE question with the numbers in hand (the options can cite them).
2. Resolve the product being promoted (named by the user, else the top seller in the window) and its offer.
3. Derive the baseline: campaign open/click rate, base size and trend, channel mix and its trend, largest relevant tags.
4. Shape phases as a narrative that tightens the audience each phase (broad engaged base -> engaged in previous phase -> qualified non-buyers), with a measured size per phase.
5. Set targets as baseline + a bounded uplift justified by the tighter audience; never a round number pulled from nowhere. Baseline from fewer than 100 reached recipients → show the sample (`3 de 7`), call it a directional reference, and make the first phase's target "medir o baseline real"; never chain later targets off an earlier target.
6. Map every phase to Clickmax building blocks (tag, segment/list, automation, email, WhatsApp template, page/offer) so it can be built.
7. Offer to build phase 1; build nothing without explicit consent.

## Execute guide

1. `mcp__plugin_clickmax_clickmax__account_snapshot` with `windowDays = 90`. Read `unavailable` first — a source listed there was not read; say so, never fill it in. `emailCampaigns.baseline: null` with no `broadcasts` in `unavailable` = the account never sent an email campaign. `emailCampaigns.baselineTruncated: true` → call it "baseline das últimas 200 campanhas" whenever you cite it.
2. Brand voice is already in the snapshot as `brand`; call `mcp__plugin_clickmax_clickmax__brand_get` alone only to reread it later. If `brand` is null or its `status` is `draft`, ask one question about tone (or offer to set up the brand) before writing copy angles.
3. If `emailCampaigns.baseline.campaigns` is below 3, also use `mcp__plugin_clickmax_clickmax__messages_metrics` for the same window to get an automation-inclusive email open rate, and label it as such. Need more than the 10 campaigns in `emailCampaigns.recent`? Use `mcp__plugin_clickmax_clickmax__broadcasts_list` with `channel = email`.
4. For the best past campaign, use `mcp__plugin_clickmax_clickmax__broadcasts_insights` to extract the best send hours (`opensByHour`) and the most-clicked link (`topLinks`) — reuse them as scheduling and CTA evidence.
5. Resolve audiences: match the user's words to `tags` from the snapshot (top 15 by size; `mcp__plugin_clickmax_clickmax__tags_list` / `mcp__plugin_clickmax_clickmax__lists_list` for the full set); measure each phase's audience with `mcp__plugin_clickmax_clickmax__segments_preview_count`. Combined audience (tag A AND tag B, tag AND temperature) = one top-level filter item per condition, each with a short label `id` ("a", "b"), `valueUuid` = the real tag id, `temperatureStatus` via `valueString`. Report the measured count, not an estimate.
6. WhatsApp: `mcp__plugin_clickmax_clickmax__channel_instances_list`, then `mcp__plugin_clickmax_clickmax__gupshup_templates_list`; if approved templates exist, `mcp__plugin_clickmax_clickmax__gupshup_template_analytics` on the most used one (by its `externalId`) for read/click rates.
7. Product: the user's product, else `topProducts` from the snapshot or `mcp__plugin_clickmax_clickmax__insights_top_offers`.
8. Write the plan with [the plan template](references/plan-template.md).
9. End by offering concrete next actions: create the phase-1 tags and segment, build the phase-1 automation, draft the first email in the brand voice. Only execute after the user says yes.

## Report

- Open with "Diagnóstico da conta": 4–6 lines, each a number with its source window (base size + trend, campaign open/click baseline, channel mix and trend, relevant tags with sizes, product).
- Every KPI target shows `baseline -> target` (e.g. "abertura 29,5% -> 33%").
- Every audience shows how it is built in Clickmax and its measured size.
- Mark anything not measured as `estimativa` explicitly.
- Keep copy angles in the brand's tone and vocabulary; never use words in `voiceVocabulary.avoid`.
- Follow the language of the user.

## Warnings

- Do not invent tag names, list names or past results. If a needed tag does not exist, list it under "a criar".
- Do not promise features the account does not have (email-engagement segment filters, waitlist entity, free-form WhatsApp outside the 24h window).
- Do not state a campaign open rate from `mcp__plugin_clickmax_clickmax__messages_metrics`, or a channel rate from one campaign.
- Tag counts overlap: never add tag counts together — measure the combination with `mcp__plugin_clickmax_clickmax__segments_preview_count`; only if that call fails, show each tag's own count and say the combination was not measured.
- Dates: compute from today; name weekdays correctly; keep hard deadlines consistent across phases and messages.
- Urgency claims ("7 vagas restantes") must come from the user's real numbers — ask, or leave as a placeholder the user must fill.

## Anti-patterns

- Writing the plan first and fetching data "if the user asks".
- A generic 5-month template with round targets and no baseline.
- Audiences described as "contatos engajados" with no filter and no size.
- Ending with a list of options instead of offering to build phase 1.
